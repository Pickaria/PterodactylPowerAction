servers:
  # "survival" is the name of the configured server in your "velocity.toml" file
  # "Server ID" should be replaced with the identifier of your server in Pterodactyl
  # The Server ID can be found under the "Debug Information" section in the "Settings" tab of your server
  survival: "Server ID"
waiting_server_name: "limbo" # "limbo" is the name of the configured server in your "velocity.toml" file
# "ping" will ping the server through the Velocity proxy to check if the server is running
# "pterodactyl" will use the Pterodactyl API instead, you may use this if you encounter issues with the regular ping
# The ping method is lighter and usually faster, however, the pterodactyl method may be more accurate
# Note that "pterodactyl_api_key" and "pterodactyl_client_api_base_url" must be configured to use the pterodactyl method
ping_method: "ping" # can be "ping" or "pterodactyl", defaults to ping
maximum_ping_duration: 60 # in seconds, defaults to 1 minute
shutdown_after_duration: 3_600 # in seconds, defaults to 1 hour
