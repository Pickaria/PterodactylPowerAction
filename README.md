A resource-saving Velocity plugin that automatically manages your Minecraft servers by starting them on demand and
shutting them down when idle, using either the [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/) API or shell commands.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üîå **Energy & Resource Saving** - Automatically shuts down empty servers after a configurable idle period (default: 1
  hour)

- üöÄ **On-Demand Server Startup** - Starts servers only when players need them, optimizing resource usage

- üîÑ **Seamless Player Experience**:

## How it Works

When a player tries to connect to a stopped server, they're temporarily sent to your waiting server while
PterodactylPowerAction starts their requested destination. Once the server is ready, they're automatically transferred.
The plugin monitors player activity and intelligently shuts down empty servers to save resources.

## Waiting/Limbo servers

Here is a small list of recommended lightweights servers software to use as waiting server:

- [PicoLimbo](https://github.com/Quozul/PicoLimbo)
- [NanoLimbo](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/86198/)
- [Limbo](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/82468/)

Note that the waiting server does not have to be a limbo server specifically, it can be any server as long as it is
always accessible. If you have a dedicated lobby server in your network, you can use that, no need for a dedicated limbo
server!

## Motivations

I am running Minecraft servers on dedicated hardware at home, I wanted to save energy costs and memory usage by stopping
empty servers. Running the waiting server on a low power ARM Single Board Computer can also further save costs.
